## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-31

Completes the lint "detective floor", then adds five new commands plus richer
ingest and two derived-view exporters — all additive and preserving the
zero-dependency, hand-editable core. `lint --check` remains the only correctness
guarantee; every new artifact is a regenerable cache, never a source of truth.

### Added
- **`compile`** — regenerate a human-readable index into a git-ignored `_index/` directory (grouped by type); a derived cache, never authoritative.
- **`advise`** — read-only curation report (stale entries, orphans, sources lacking a distilling note, aliasable topics), plus a `research-librarian` skill. Never mutates the vault.
- **`obsidian`** — derived, non-mutating Obsidian view: one `[[wikilink]]` stub per entry (forward links + backlinks) plus a Map-of-Content, written to a git-ignored `_obsidian/` directory.
- **`refresh`** — opt-in web freshness re-check: fetch a source URL, recompute its `content_hash`, and report `confirmed` / `changed` / `unreachable` without mutating any entry. Off by default and double-gated (`RESEARCH_VAULT_ALLOW_NETWORK=1` **and** the subcommand).
- **`export`** — read-only JSONL export for external finetuning/eval; emits answered-question summaries + per-entry metadata by default.
- **`capture --scaffold`** — opt-in per-type body skeletons (`vault-template/meta/entry-skeletons/<type>.md`).
- **`capture --content-file` / `--captured-via` / `--store-body`** — hash content from a local file, record provenance, and (with `--ack-data-egress`) store source text in the body. No network.
- Non-blocking **`SessionStart`** Claude Code hook that prints a one-line vault summary (entries + stale count).
- **`search --body`** — opt-in substring scan of entry bodies.
- **`vault-template/.gitignore`** so initialized vaults ignore derived caches (`.vault-manifest.json`, `_index/`, `_obsidian/`).
- New slash commands: `/research-advise`, `/research-compile`, `/research-obsidian`.

### Changed
- **Detective floor completed.** `lint` now validates every controlled enum (`confidence`, `outcome`, `question_state`, verification `by_type`), and `lint --check` compares the **full** manifest — including `backlinks` — for staleness; the manifest is canonicalized (sorted entries + backlinks) for determinism.
- **Fail-fast mutators.** `capture` and `verify` reject unknown controlled values up front via a shared `bin/lib/validate.mjs`, writing nothing on a bad value.
- `verify` now validates `result` against the taxonomy and refuses `outdated` without `--superseded-by`.
- `listStale` moved to `bin/lib/stale.mjs` (removes a `lib → commands` import).
- Spec aligned with the implementation: retired `INDEX.md`, `taxonomy.yaml` → `taxonomy.json`, documented `search --body`, corrected the generated-`AGENTS.md` framing.
- README: command surface synced (all 12 commands), added "Two ways to use it" (prose vs. command) and "Team use" sections, renamed Security → "Security & privacy".

### Fixed
- **Hook path containment.** Replaced the unsafe `startsWith` vault-containment check with a resolved-path, separator-aware `isInsideVault` (rejects siblings like `<vault>-evil` and cross-drive paths); switched the hook to exec-form invocation.

### Security
- **`refresh` SSRF guard (allowlist posture).** Only global-unicast addresses are accepted; all RFC 6890 private / loopback / link-local / CGNAT / ULA / documentation / multicast / reserved ranges are rejected — including IPv4-mapped/translated/compatible IPv6 forms, 6to4, NAT64, the cloud-metadata address `169.254.169.254`, and alternate numeric host encodings. The socket is pinned to the pre-validated IP (no re-resolution, no pooling), every redirect hop is re-validated, scheme downgrades are forbidden, and body-size + timeout caps bound each request; no cookies or auth headers are sent.
- **Data-egress gating.** `export` emits entry bodies only with **both** `--include-bodies` and `--ack-data-egress` (metadata-only by default); `capture --store-body` likewise requires `--ack-data-egress`.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release.

### Added
- Zero-dependency Node ≥18 ESM CLI: `init`, `lint`, `capture`, `verify`, `search`, `related`, `manifest`.
- Schema-driven taxonomy (`schema/taxonomy.json` + `schema/frontmatter.schema.json`) as the single source of truth for vocabulary and field rules.
- Six entry types (sources, notes, synthesis, snippets, experiments, questions) with a deliberate `sources → notes → synthesis` distillation flow.
- Freshness governance: per-entry `volatility` tiers + a verification log; URL + version dedup; a computed backlink manifest.
- `lint` / `lint --check` correctness floor; generated `AGENTS.md`; encoding/drift CI gates across {Linux, macOS, Windows} × Node {18, 20, 22}.
- Claude Code plugin: skills (`research-vault-usage`, `research-capture`, `research-verify`) and an optional `PostToolUse` lint-fix hook.
